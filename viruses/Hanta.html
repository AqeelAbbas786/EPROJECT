                </div>
            <dd>Here are some key points about the hanta virus :</dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Hantaviruses are a family of viruses which can cause serious illnesses and death.
                </li>
                <img class="virus-img"  src="virusespics\hantavirus\hanta virus.jfif" alt="">
                <li>These viruses cause diseases like hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
                </li>
                <li>They are spread mainly by rodents and are not spread from person-to-person.
                </li>
            </ul>
                <dd>Hantaviruses can infect and cause serious disease in people worldwide. People get hantavirus from contact with rodents like rats and mice, especially when exposed to their urine, droppings, and saliva. It can also spread through a bite or scratch by a rodent, but this is rare.
                    <br>
                    Hantaviruses cause two syndromes. Hantaviruses found in the Western Hemisphere, including here in the U.S., can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The most common hantavirus that causes HPS in the U.S. is spread by the deer mouse.
                    <br>
                    Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses found mostly in Europe and Asia. However, Seoul virus, a type of hantavirus that causes HFRS, is found worldwide, including in the United States.</dd>
                    <dt class="dt">Year Originated</dt>
                  
            <dd>In 1976, the first pathogenic hantavirus, the Hantaan orthohantavirus, was isolated from rodents near the Hantan River in South Korea.</dd>
            <img class="virus-img"  src="virusespics\hantavirus\Geographical-representation-of-approximate-hantaviral-disease-incidence-by-country-per.png" alt="">
            <dd> Other prominent hantaviruses that cause HFRS, including the Dobrava-Belgrade orthohantavirus, Puumala orthohantavirus, and Seoul orthohantavirus, were identified in the years after then and are collectively referred to as the Old World hantaviruses.</dd>
            <dd>In late medieval England a mysterious sweating sickness swept through the country in 1485 just before the Battle of Bosworth Field. Noting that the symptoms overlap with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, several scientists have theorized that the virus may have been the cause of the disease.[54][55] The hypothesis was criticized because sweating sickness was recorded as being transmitted from human to human, whereas hantaviruses were not known to spread in this way.</dd>
            <dt class="dt">Damage</dt><br>
            <img class="virus-img"  src="virusespics\hantavirus\IMG-20240621-WA0033.jpg" alt="">
            <br><br>
            <dd>Here are some words related to hanta virus damage:</dd>
            <dd>Eliminate or minimize contact with rodents in your home, workplace, or campsite to reduce your risk of exposure to hantaviruses. Seal holes and gaps in your home or garage to keep rodents from entering these spaces. Place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation. Clean up any easy-to-get food, that might attract rodents.</dd>
           <br>
            <dt class="dt">Symptoms</dt>
            <dt>Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)</dt>
            <dd>HPS is a severe and potentially deadly disease that affects the lungs. Symptoms of HPS usually start to show 1 to 8 weeks after contact with an infected rodent.</dd>
            <dt>Early symptoms can include:</dt>
            <ul>
                <li>Fever</li>
                <li>fatigue</li>
                <li>muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups like the thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders</li>
            </ul>
            <dt>About half of all HPS patients also experience:</dt>
            <ul>
                <li>headaches</li>
                <li>dizziness</li>
                <li>chills</li>
                <li>abdominal problems, like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain</li>
            </ul>
           <dd>Four to 10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS appear. These symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath. Patients might experience tightness in the chest, as the lungs fill with fluid.
            <br>
            HPS can be deadly. Thirty-eight percent of people who develop respiratory symptoms may die from the disease.</dd>
            <dt>Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS)</dt>
            <dd>HFRS is a severe and sometimes deadly disease that affects the kidneys. Symptoms of HFRS usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure. In rare cases, they may take up to 8 weeks to develop. Initial symptoms begin suddenly and include:</dd>
            <ul>
                <li>intense headaches</li>
                <li>back and abdominal pain</li>
                <li>fever/chills</li>
                <li>nausea</li>
                <li>blurred vision</li>
            </ul>
            <dd>People may have flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms can include:</dd>
            <ul>
                <li>low blood pressure</li>
                <li>lack of blood flow (acute shock)</li>
                <li>internal bleeding (vascular leakage)</li>
                <li>acute kidney failure, which can cause severe fluid overload</li>
            </ul>
            <dd>The severity of the disease varies depending on the virus causing the infection. Hantaan and Dobrava virus infections usually cause severe symptoms where 5-15% of cases are fatal. In contrast, Seoul, Saaremaa, and Puumala virus infections are usually more moderate with less than 1% dying from the disease. Complete recovery can take several weeks to months.</dd>
           
            <dt class="dt">Treatment</dt>
            <img class="virus-img"  src="virusespics\hantavirus\IMG-20240621-WA0025.jpg" alt=""><br>
            <dd>There is no specific treatment for hantavirus infection. Patients should receive supportive care, including rest, hydration, and treatment of symptoms.
                <br>
               
                HPS can cause breathing difficulties, and patients may need breathing support, such as intubation. Intubation is a medical procedure where a tube is placed in the lungs from the mouth to help the patient get oxygen.
                <br>
                HFRS can disrupt kidney function. Patients with HFRS may need dialysis to remove toxins from the blood and maintain the right balance of fluids in the body when the kidneys aren't working well.</dd>
                <dt>Ribavirin</dt>
                <dd>Effectiveness of ribavirin against some Hantaviruses had been proved in vitro and to some extent in vivo. Efficacy of ribavirin therapy against HFRS has been evaluated using a Hantaan virus–infected suckling mouse model with various doses of ribavirin. Treatment with 50 mg of ribavirin/kg per day beginning on day 10 of the viral challenge demonstrated a higher survival rate compared with placebo controls in mice [20]. Ribavirin efficacy against Andes virus–related HPS has been shown in vitro using Vero E6 cells and in vivo using a lethal hamster HPS model. In hamsters, treatment with as little as 5 mg/kg per day was effective in preventing lethal HPS disease when therapy was administered via intraperitoneal injection from day 01 through day 10 post-infection [21]. Ribavirin remained 100% protective when administered via intraperitoneal injections up to 03 days following infection [21]. </dd>
                <dt>Favipiravir</dt>
                <img class="virus-img"  src="virusespics\hantavirus\IMG-20240621-WA0024.jpg" alt="">
                <dd>Favipiravir (T-705) potently inhibits SNV and ANDV in vitro [27]. For both viruses, the 90% effective concentration was estimated at ≤ 5 μg/ml. In the lethal ANDV hamster model, the daily administration of oral T-705 at 50 or 100 mg/kg significantly improved the survival rate. Oral T-705 therapy remained protective against HPS when treatment was initiated prior to the onset of viremia. Using a hamster-adapted SNV, daily administration of oral T-705 significantly reduced the detection of SNV RNA and antigen in tissue specimens, suggesting that the compound would also be effective against HPS. T-705 is well tolerated in humans, with no significant adverse effects noted in human clinical trials. Supporting the low toxicity of this compound, the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of T-705 is at least 6 times greater than that of ribavirin in hamsters [28].</dd>
                <dt>Lactoferrin</dt>
                <dd>Efficacy of lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein, against Hantavirus has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo [29, 30]. The result of both studies has shown the antiviral activity of lactoferrin against Hantavirus by inhibition of virus adsorption to the cells. And also complete inhibition of foci formation with lactoferrin and ribavirin in vitro demonstrated the synergetic effect of both drugs. In vivo lactoferrin pre-treatment was evaluated by administration of 40 and 160 mg/kg concentrations prior to Hantavirus viral challenge in suckling mice and improved survival rates were demonstrated to 15% and 70% with a single administration and 85% and 94% with double administration, respectively.</dd>
                <dt>ETAR</dt>
                <dd>1-β-d-Ribofuranosyl-3-ethynyl-[1,2,4]triazole (ETAR) is a nucleoside analog which is active against HTNV and ANDV Hantavirus in vitro. Intraperitoneally delivered ETAR has offered protection to suckling mice at 10 days after being challenged with HTNV with around 25% survival at 12.5 and 25 mg/kg of ETAR [44].</dd>
               
                <dt class="dt">World Health Organization (WHO) response</dt>
                <dd>The Panama Ministry of Health has reported an increase in cases of hantavirus infection in Los Santos Province, Republic of Panama, to the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO). Between 1 January and 22 December 2018, a total of 103 confirmed cases of hantavirus have been reported at the national level, 99 of which were reported in Los Santos Province. In Los Santos Province, 51 cases were classified as hantavirus fever1 (HF) without pulmonary syndrome and 48 cases were classified as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome2 (HPS), including four deaths.</dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>Of the 51 HF cases, 41% were female, 55% aged between 20-59 years, with 76% occurring between June 2018 and November 2018.</li>
                    <li>Of the 48 HPS cases, 56% were female, 67% aged between 20-59 years, with more than half of the cases occurring in February 2018 (17%) and between June 2018 and September 2018 (42%)</li>
                    <li>Four deaths were reported among HPS cases (two female, two male, all aged over 60 years).</li>
                </ul>
                <dd>Cases were confirmed by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)3. Sequencing determined that the type of virus associated with this outbreak is Choclo virus. It was first isolated in 1999 in the western Republic of Panama.
                    <br>
                    Hantavirus cases have been reported in the Republic of Panama since 1999. In the last five years, transmission has been documented in Los Santos, Herrera, Veraguas, and Cocle provinces. During 2018, cases have been reported in Los Santos , Herrera (two cases), Cocle (one case) and Veraguas (one case) provinces . Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents and transmission can occur when people come in contact with rodent habitats, the current increase in hantavirus cases in the Republic of Panama could be related to changes in the abundance and distribution of rodent species, as well as strengthened surveillance and laboratory capacity at the provincial level. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends.</dd>
