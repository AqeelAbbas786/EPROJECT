                </div>
            <dd>Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is caused by a variety of infectious viruses  and noninfectious agents leading to a range of health problems, some of which can be fatal. There are five main strains of the hepatitis virus, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. While they all cause liver disease, they differ in important ways including modes of transmission, severity of the illness, geographical distribution and prevention methods. </dd>
            <dd>Some types of hepatitis are preventable through vaccination. A WHO study found that an estimated 4.5 million premature deaths could be prevented in low- and middle-income countries by 2030 through vaccination, diagnostic tests, medicines and education campaigns. WHO’s global hepatitis strategy, endorsed by all WHO Member States, aims to reduce new hepatitis infections by 90% and deaths by 65% between 2016 and 2030.</dd>
            <dt>Hepatitis A</dt>
            <dd>Hepatitis A is the result of an infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). This type of hepatitis is an acute, short-term disease.</dd>
            <dt>Hepatitis B</dt><br>
            <img class="virus-img"  src="virusespics\hepatitisvirus\Causes-of-Hepatitis-Virus.jpeg" alt=""><br><br><br><br>
            <dd>The hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes hepatitis B. This is often an ongoing, chronic condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that around 826,000Trusted Source people are living with chronic hepatitis B in the United States and around 257 million people worldwide.</dd>
            <br><br><br>
            <dt>Hepatitis C</dt>
            <dd>Hepatitis C comes from the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is among the most common bloodborne viral infections in the United States and typically presents as a long-term condition.
<br>
            According to the CDC, approximately 2.4 million AmericansTrusted Source are currently living with a chronic form of this infection.
                
                </dd>
            <dt>Hepatitis D</dt>
            <dd>This is a rare form of hepatitis that only occurs in conjunction with hepatitis B infection. The hepatitis D virus (HDV) causes liver inflammation like other strains, but a person cannot contract HDV without an existing hepatitis B infection.
                <br>
            Globally, HDV affects almost 5 percentTrusted Source of people with chronic hepatitis B.</dd>
            <dt>Hepatitis E</dt>
            <dd>Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease that results from exposure to the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is mainly found in areas with poor sanitation and typically results from ingesting fecal matter that contaminates the water supply.
<br>
                This disease is uncommonTrusted Source in the United States, according to the CDC.
    <br>            
                Hepatitis E is usually acute but can be particularly dangerous in pregnant women.</dd>
                <dt class="dt">Year Originated</dt>
                <dd>Disease outbreaks resembling hepatitis A have been known since antiquity. However, it was not until World War II when two forms of viral hepatitis were clearly differentiated. After the discovery of Australia antigen and its association with hepatitis B, similar methodologies were used to find the hepatitis A virus. The virus was ultimately identified when investigators changed the focus of their search from serum to feces and applied appropriate technology.</dd>
                <dd>Diseases resembling hepatitis A, both in individuals and in
                    <img class="virus-img"  src="virusespics\hepatitisvirus\hapatitis.jpg" alt=""> outbreaks involving groups, were reported in China as early as 5000 years ago. Hippocrates noted a disease he called benign epidemic jaundice in “De Morbis Internis” that certainly resembled hepatitis A. More accurate descriptions of hepatitis A began appearing in the 17th century often associated with military campaigns. The first outbreak recorded in the United States was in 1812 in Norfolk, VA, and the disease was common among the Union troops during the Civil War with more than 40,000 cases reported. The association of hepatitis A with war led to 19th-century terms such as “kriegsikterus” or “jaunisse des camps.” Hepatitis A continued to afflict troops on both sides during World War I and in the Second World War when there were estimates of 16 million cases of hepatitis among combatants and civilians</dd>
            <dt class="dt">Damage</dt>
            <dd>Here are some words related to hepatitis damage:</dd>
            <dd>Excess alcohol consumption can cause liver damage and inflammation. This may also be referred to as alcoholic hepatitis.
                <br>
                The alcohol directly injures the cells of your liver. Over time, it can cause permanent damage and lead to thickening or scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis) and liver failure.
                <br>
                Other toxic causes of hepatitis include misuse of medications and exposure to toxins.</dd>
          <dd>In some cases, the immune system mistakes the liver as harmful and attacks it. This causes ongoing inflammation that can range from mild to severe, often hindering liver function. It’s three times more common in women than in men.</dd>
            <dt class="dt">Symptoms</dt>
            <dd>Many people with hepatitis A, B, C, D or E exhibit only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Each form of the virus, however, can cause more severe symptoms. Symptoms of hepatitis A, B and C may include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). In some cases, the virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. These patients are at risk of death.
                <br>
               
            Hepatitis D (HDV) is only found in people already infected with hepatitis B (HBV); however, the dual infection of HBV and HDV can cause a more serious infection and poorer health outcomes, including accelerated progression to cirrhosis. Development of chronic hepatitis D is rare.
                <br>
            Hepatitis E (HEV) begins with mild fever, reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting lasting for a few days. Some persons may also have abdominal pain, itching (without skin lesions), skin rash or joint pain. They may also exhibit jaundice, with dark urine and pale stools, and a slightly enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly), or occasionally acute liver failure.</dd>
            <dt>Common symptoms of hepatitis</dt>
            <dd>If you are living with a chronic form of hepatitis, like hepatitis B and C, you may not show symptoms until the damage affects liver function. By contrast, people with acute hepatitis may present with symptoms shortly after contracting a hepatitis virus.</dd>
            <dd>Common symptoms of infectious hepatitis include:</dd>
            <img class="virus-img"  src="virusespics\hepatitisvirus\pasted image 0.jpg" alt=""> 
            <ul>
                <li>fatigue</li>
                <li>flu-like symptoms</li>
                <li>dark urine</li>
                <li>pale stool</li>
                <li>abdominal pain</li>
                <li>loss of appetite</li>
                <li>unexplained weight loss</li>
                <li>yellow skin and eyes, which may be signs of jaundice</li>
            </ul><br>
            <dt class="dt">Treatment</dt>
            <dd>Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV). This vaccine also prevents the development of hepatitis D virus (HDV) and given at birth strongly reduces transmission risk from mother to child. Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with antiviral agents. Treatment can slow the progression of cirrhosis, reduce incidence of liver cancer and improve long term survival. Only a proportion of people with chronic hepatitis B infection will require treatment. A vaccine also exists to prevent infections of hepatitis E (HEV), although it is not currently widely available. There are no specific treatments for HBV and HEV and hospitalization is not usually required. It is advised to avoid unnecessary medications due to the negative effect on liver function caused by these infections.</dd>
           
                <dt class="dt">Prevention</dt>
                <dd>The prevention of hepatitis transmission varies depending on the type.
                    <br>
                    Experts recommend regular screening for hepatitis A, B and C for those at higher risk. Doctors also routinely screen for hepatitis B and C during pregnancy.
                    <br>
                    The sections below discuss means of prevention by type.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Hepatitis A and E</dt>
                    <dd>Hepatitis A and E are most commonly spread through food and water that has come into contact with the feces of a person with the virus.</dd>
                    <img class="virus-img"  src="virusespics\hepatitisvirus\IMG-20240621-WA0027.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                    <dd>Some ways of preventing infection include:</dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>washing the hands carefully after using the bathroom and before eating</li>
                    <li>ensuring that food is fully cooked and appropriately stored</li>
                    <li>drinking only bottled water when traveling</li>
                    <li>avoiding or peeling fruits and vegetables that may have been washed or grown in unsanitized water</li>
                </ul>
                <dd>People may ask their doctor about the hepatitis A vaccine, especially if they are traveling to an area where the virus is prevalent.</dd>
                <dt>Hepatitis B, C, and D</dt>
                <dd>To minimize the risk of transmission, where relevant, a person should:</dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>talk openly with any sexual partners about any viruses they may have</li>
                    <li>only use previously unused, clean needles</li>
                    <li>avoid sharing toothbrushes, razors, and manicure instruments </li>
                    <li>check that any tattoo or acupuncture equipment is sterile</li>
                </ul>
                
                <dd>People with a high risk of exposure to hepatitis B can ask their doctor about vaccination, but there is no vaccination for hepatitis C.
                    <br>
                    People who believe they may have hepatitis should seek medical help. A healthcare professional can advise on a person’s treatment, reduce the risk of complications and avoid transmitting the virus.
                    <br>
                    In people with HIV, there is a higher risk of contracting a hepatitis B or C infection. The impact can also be more severe, as the body is less able to fight the infection.
                    <br>
                    To lower their risk of hepatitis infection and complications, people with HIV should:</dd>
                    <ul>
                        <li>take precautions to prevent infection and transmission of hepatitis</li>
                        <li>attend all health checks</li>
                        <li>adhere to their treatment plan</li>
                    </ul>
                    <dd>Immunization can prevent hepatitis A and B, but not C. Treatment is available for hepatitis B and C, but not A.</dd>
              
                <dt class="dt">World Health Organization (WHO) response</dt>
                <dd>Hepatitis C (HCV) can cause both acute and chronic infection. Some people recover on their own, while others develop a life-threatening infection or further complications, including cirrhosis or cancer. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of persons with hepatitis C infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer, but access to diagnosis and treatment remains low.</dd>
                <dd>The disease is the second leading infectious cause of death globally, with 1.3 million deaths per year, the same as tuberculosis, another top infectious killer, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Global Hepatitis Report.
                    <br>
                    “This report paints a troubling picture,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Despite progress globally in preventing hepatitis infections, deaths are rising because far too few people with hepatitis are being diagnosed and treated.”</dd>
